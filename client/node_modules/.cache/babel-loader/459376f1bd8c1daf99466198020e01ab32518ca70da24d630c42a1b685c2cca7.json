We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever before sending Shipment Confirmation to you. 1.4 If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive separate Shipment Confirmations for each package, and each Shipment Confirmation and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the Product(s) specified in that Shipment Confirmation. 1.5 Any communication from us shall be sent only to your registered mobile number and/or email address or such other contact number or email address that you may designate, for any particular transaction.

Please note that we sell Products only in quantities which correspond to the usual requirements of an average household. This applies both to the number of Products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same Product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household. 1.7 All orders placed on the Platforms are subject to the availability of such Product, our acceptance of your offer as per the above and your continued adherence to these Terms of Sale. 1.8 You hereby authorise us to declare and provide declarations to any governmental authority on request on your behalf, including that the Products ordered by you are for personal, non-commercial use. 2.

The prices mentioned at the time of ordering will be the prices charged on the date of the delivery. 5.

FORCE MAJEURE We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with its obligations if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. 11. WAIVER No provision in these Terms of Sale will be deemed waived and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by us.

By placing an order for any Product with us or making a purchase of Product, you expressly agree to be bound by these Terms of Sale.\n\nThese Terms of Sale are in addition to the Agreement. These Terms of Sale constitute an electronic record within the meaning of the applicable law. This electronic record is generated by a computer system and does not require any physical or digital signatures.\n\n1. OUR CONTRACT OF SALE\n\n1.1 Listing and display of a Product by us on the Platforms is our invitation to you to make an offer for purchase of such Product. Likewise, the placement of an order on the Platforms by you is your offer to buy the Product(s) from us.\n\n1.2 Once you have placed an order with us for purchase of a Product, you will receive an e-mail and/or mobile SMS confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the “Order Confirmation”). The Order Confirmation is merely an acknowledgement that we have received your order and does not signify our acceptance of your offer.\n\n1.3 We only accept your offer and conclude the contract of sale for a Product ordered by you, when the Product is shipped or dispatched to you and an e-mail and/or registered mobile number confirmation is sent to you that the Product has been shipped or dispatched to you (the “Shipment Confirmation”). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever before sending Shipment Confirmation to you.\n\n1.4 If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive separate Shipment Confirmations for each package, and each Shipment Confirmation and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the Product(s) specified in that Shipment Confirmation.\n\n1.5 Any communication from us shall be sent only to your registered mobile number and/or email address or such other contact number or email address that you may designate, for any particular transaction. You shall be solely responsible to update your registered mobile number and/or email address on the Platforms in the event there is a change. Further, we may also send you notifications and reminders with respect to scheduled deliveries of the purchased Products. While we shall make every endeavour to share prompt reminders and notifications relating to the delivery of purchased Product(s) with you, we shall not be held liable for any failure to send such notifications or reminders to you. \n\n1.6 Your contract is with us and you confirm that the Product(s) ordered by you are purchased for your internal / personal purpose and not for re-sale or business purpose. Please note that we sell Products only in quantities which correspond to the usual requirements of an average household. This applies both to the number of Products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same Product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.\n\n1.7 All orders placed on the Platforms are subject to the availability of such Product, our acceptance of your offer as per the above and your continued adherence to these Terms of Sale.\n\n1.8 You hereby authorise us to declare and provide declarations to any governmental authority on request on your behalf, including that the Products ordered by you are for personal, non-commercial use.\n\n2.

The prices mentioned at the time of ordering will be the prices charged on the date of the delivery.\n\n5.
